## Configure

- To ensure Husky is setup correctly, it may be required to run `npx husky-init` from the root of the repository after running `npm install`. Once this is done the contents of the hooks in the `.husky` directory will need to be checked to ensure the same file permissions as the newly created `pre-commit`.
- To ensure failed tests do not fail a build before we can report on results, add `testOptions { unitTests.all { setIgnoreFailures(true) } }` to the modules `build.gradle`.

# Once repository is configured, delete this section.
